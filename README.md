# Elm support on Travis-CI

This repo contains information and scripts to assist in maintenance and debugging of Elm support for [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org).

The original PR to add Elm support to Travis-CI is [travis-ci/travis-ci#934](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build/pull/934).  Part of the process of getting Elm support approved is to have a group of at least three people willing to provide support for travis issues related to the language plugin.  The current maintainers are listed at [elm-community/Manifesto/maintainers.md](https://github.com/elm-community/Manifesto/blob/master/maintainers.md).
